A bright ray of sunshine unveils the darkness.

Suddenly there was only light in the hearts of the villagers.

They stood, with gratitude in their hears, and sang together a prayer to the Universe.

Their voices echoed across the canyon floor.

Their tears became streams.

Washing away all sorrows with their tears, only joy was left in the wake of the Sun!
